# The Network

### How does it work?

Network refers to the entire network of servers that are connected to a hub. In this area, you can send messages that will appear in other channels that have been set up on other servers.

### Using the Network

Once you have finished [joining a hub](../hub-basics/interaction.md), you should be able to send a message in the channel used to recieve messages from the hub. When your message is sent, InterChat broadcasts it across the network to other servers that are part of the hub.

Here is a picture of how it might look like to other servers:

### Reporting messages/Users

Use the `Report` context menu by **right-clicking** a message you wish to report. Note that, messages sent outside the network channel (the channel that is selected to recieve messages from the hub) will not work. Or, to report anything else use the `/support report` slash command.
