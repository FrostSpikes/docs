# Setup Up InterChat

Setting up InterChat is easy and allows you to chat across different servers. Follow these steps to set up InterChat:

## 1. Find a Hub:

Use the command `/hub browse` to see available hubs.

   - Or use `/hub browse <search>` to look for a specific hub.

## 2. Join a Hub:

Once you find a hub you like, choose a text channel, forum post or a thread channel in your server to connect to the hub.

   - Use `/hub join <hub> <channel>` to connect.
   - You can also join a hub directly through the hub browser (`/hub browse`) using the "join" button.
   - Learn more about joining a hub in the [Joining a Hub](./hub/joining.md) section.

## 3. Manage your Connections:

- **Temporarily Disconnect from a Hub:**
   - Use `/network manage` to temporarily disconnect from a hub. You can reconnect anytime using the same command.

- **Permanently Leave a Hub:**
   - Use `/hub leave` to leave a hub permanently. You can rejoin the same or another hub anytime using `/hub join <hub> <channel>`.

## 4. Explore and Join More Hubs:

- Use `/hub browse` to find and join other hubs. Remember, you can only join one hub per channel. If you want to join a new hub in the same channel, you'll need to leave the current hub.

Now you're all set to chat seamlessly across different servers! 🚀
