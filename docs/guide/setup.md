# Setting up InterChat
Setting up InterChat is a straightforward process that enables you to chat across various servers. Follow the steps below to get started!:

### Discover and Join Hubs:
To explore available public hubs, use the command `/hub browse`. Navigate using the arrows and locate a hub that interests you. Once you've found one, click 'Join,' then select your preferred channel. This will connect the channel to the hub! You also have the option to join Private hubs by using the command `/hub join <channel> <invite code>`."
Learn more about joining a hub in the [Joining a Hub](./hub/joining.md) section.

### **Manage your Connections:**
- **Temporarily Disconnect from a Hub:** - Use `/network manage` to temporarily disconnect from a hub. You can reconnect anytime using the same command.
- **Permanently Leave a Hub:** - Use `/hub leave` to leave a hub permanently. You can rejoin the same or another hub anytime using `/hub join <hub> <channel>`.

### Explore and Join More Hubs:
- Use `/hub browse` to find and join other hubs. Remember, you can only join one hub per channel. If you want to join a new hub in the same channel, you'll need to leave the current hub.

Now you're all set to chat seamlessly across different servers! ðŸš€
