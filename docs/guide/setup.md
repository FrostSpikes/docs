# Setting up InterChat
Setting up InterChat is a straightforward process that enables you to chat across various servers. Follow the steps below to get started!:

### Discover and Join Hubs:
To explore available public hubs, use the command `/hub browse`. Navigate using the arrows to locate a hub that interests you. Once you've found one, click 'Join,' and then select your preferred channel. This will connect the channel to the hub!

  - Use `/hub join <hub> <channel>` to connect.
  - You can also join a hub directly through the hub browser (`/hub browse`) using the "join" button.
  - Learn more about joining a hub in the [Joining a Hub](./hub/joining.md) section.

### **Manage your Connections:**
- **Temporarily Disconnect from a Hub:** - Use `/network manage` to temporarily disconnect from a hub. You can reconnect anytime using the same command.
- **Permanently Leave a Hub:** - Use `/hub leave` to leave a hub permanently. You can rejoin the same or another hub anytime using `/hub join <hub> <channel>`.

### Explore and Join More Hubs:
- Use `/hub browse` to find and join other hubs. Remember, you can only join one hub per channel. If you want to join a new hub in the same channel, you'll need to leave the current hub.

Now you're all set to chat seamlessly across different servers! ðŸš€
