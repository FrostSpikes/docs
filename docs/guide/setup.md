# Setting up InterChat
Setting up InterChat is a straight-forward process that enables you to chat across various servers. Follow the steps below to get started!:

### Discover and Join Hubs:
To explore available public hubs, use the command `/hub browse`. Navigate using the arrows and locate a hub that interests you. Once you've found one, click 'Join', then select your preferred channel. This will connect the channel to the hub!

You also have the option to join Private hubs by using:
```
/hub join <channel> <invite code>
```

Remember, you can only join one hub per channel. If you want to join a new hub in the same channel, you'll need to leave the current hub. Learn more about joining a hub in the [Joining a Hub](./hub/joining.md) section.
### **Manage your Connection:**
- **Temporarily Disconnecting from a Hub:** 
Use the `/network manage` command to temporarily disconnect from a hub. You can reconnect anytime using the same command.

- **Permanently Leave a Hub:** 
Use `/hub leave` to leave a hub permanently. You can rejoin anytime using `/hub join <hub> <channel>`.

Now you're all set to chat seamlessly across different servers! 🚀
