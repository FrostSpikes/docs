# Setup

## Description

The InterChat setup command is the key to accessing the chat network and customizing your experience. Use it to connect and interact with the chat network, and to tailor your experience to your preferences.

### Sub-Commands:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Channel" %}
Choose the channel you want to connect to the chat network using the InterChat setup command. It is suggested to create a separate channel for this as it may become cluttered. You can always change the network connection settings in the setup later.

&#x20;

#### Usage:

* `/setup channel <channel>`
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Edit" %}
This subcommand allows you to view and edit your current network connection settings, allowing you to customize the look and feel of the interface, and other options.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Reset" %}
{% hint style="danger" %}
This is a destructive action. All your existing setup data will be gone once this command is used.
{% endhint %}



Completely reset your network settings by wiping out all existing data, including network connection settings, setup data, and network data.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
