# The Network

### How does it work?

Network refers to the entire network of servers that are connected. In this area, you can send messages that will appear in other channels that have been set up on other servers.

### Using the Network

Once you have finished [setup.md](../setup.md "mention"), you should be able to send a message in the set-up channel. When your message is sent, InterChat sends it to connected servers across the network.

&#x20;Here is a picture of how it might look like to other servers:

### Reporting messages/Users

Use the `Report` context menu by **right-clicking** a message you wish to report. Note that, messages sent outside the set-up channel will not work. Or, to report anything else use the `/support report` slash command.&#x20;
